# Flexop

A Flexible Command Line Parsing Framework. Initial code is from PHG project (option.h and option.c, http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/phg/). The purpose of this project is to provide a standalone command line parsing framework to support other applications. More types will be supported and more features will be provided.
