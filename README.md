# Flexop

A Flexible Command Line Parsing Framework. Initial code was from PHG project (option.h and option.c, http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/phg/). The purpose of this project is to provide a standalone command line parsing framework to support other applications.

This project has refactorized original code and new types have been supported.

Demo:
'''

 ./example -i 1 -f 1.2 -s "hi"

'''
